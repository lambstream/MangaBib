                    Welcome to the mangalibrary of KU Leuven!

                <div class="panel-content">
                	<p>Let's start with how the mangalibrary came to existence. Here is a quote from one of the creators of the mangalibrary.</p>

                	<blockquote class="place-right">
                		<p>Let's Manga is a research and implementation project of Catholic University of Leuven's Japanese Studies program. It's purpose is twofold: to support the use of manga as learning materials in our Japanese Studies courses, and to offer online research aids and support to anyone interested in researching manga and Japanese popular culture.</p>
    					<small>Hans Coppens <cite title="Source Title">japanologie.arts.kuleuven.be</cite></small>
					</blockquote>

					<p>The library is a result of the Let's Manga project. Every day, students (and non-university affiliates) come to read manga or use it for a research project. This made the library quite succesfull, definitely with the Japanology students. It's located in the Erasmus building in Leuven (specifics at the <a href="contact.html"> contact</a> page.)</p><br>

					<h5>'Temporary collection' system</h5>
					<p>Have a lot of manga lying around that you don't read but don't want to give away? Temporarily share your collection with the library so that others may enjoy your manga like you did. We will indicate your ownership of the manga in our catalog so that you can take your collection back home whenever you want. Contact us for more information.</p><br>


					<h5>There are a few rules:</h5>
					<ul><li>Anyone can borrow manga for free, also non-university affiliates. HELP US KEEP THE LIBRARY FREE by returning manga in good condition and in a timely fashion. We're trusting folk and don't want to bother with pesky things like late fees, but will start using them anyway if people take advantage of the system at the expense of others.</li>
					<li>A maximum of five manga may be borrowed at the same time, always for a period of two weeks with extensions granted only in special cases (needing the manga for a research project etc).</li></ul>


					You can borrow manga from the library, depending from the category it belongs to. There are 4 categories: A, B, C and D. Categorie D still has to be catagolized or is needed for translation work, because of that it can't be borrowed. Categories A, B and C can be borrowed.
