                    <p>The KU Leuven mangalibrary is not like any other. The basic principles are the same as in a normal library, but there are still a few questions that are often asked.</p>

                    <strong>Where does all the manga come from?</strong><br>
                    <p>All of the manga we currently have, come from the following sources: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Donations from Japanese schools</li>
                        <li>Manga from students, donated or given to the library for a specific kind of time</li>
                        <li>We purchased it for a project</li>
                    </ul> </p>

                    <strong>Is it allowed to read in the library itself?</strong><br>
                    <p>
                        Yes. We even recommend reading in our library. Some manga's can only be read in the library and not be borrowed. (Category D)
                    </p>

                    <strong>I'm a Japanese exchange student from another school, can I borrow manga as well?</strong><br>
                    <p>
                        Yes. People that suffice at one of the following criteria are allowed to borrow books from the mangalibrary:
                    <ul>
                        <li>KU Leuven students</li>
                        <li>Professors</li>
                        <li>Japanese exchange students</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <strong>How long has the mangalibrary been there? I've never noticed it...</strong>
                    <p>
                        The mangalibrary has started 8 years ago. It was thanks to the Let's Manga project that it came to existence. There have been all sorts of projects and research about manga and Japanese literature. More information about news, research, etc... can be found in the <a href="archive.html">archive</a>. Or you can check out the links on the <a href="../index.html">dashboard</a>.
                    </p>

                    <strong>I want to read some manga, but I don't speak Japanese very well</strong>
                    <p>
                        Some manga is very easy to read and uses very little kanji or difficult grammatical sentences. If that's still to hard, you can read one of our translated works.
                    </p>

                    <strong>Is it possible to browse the collection on the internet?</strong>
                    <p>
                        Yes. most of the manga's that we currently have are included in our zotero database. If you want a quick guide on how to get started, you can check the <a href="zotero.html">How to Zotero</a> page.
